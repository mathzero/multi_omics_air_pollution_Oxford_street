<h2 data-label="294068" class="ltx_title_subsection">sPLS on X Results</h2><div> The resulting set of OMICs from the GLS model represents biomarkers that show significant association with TRAP - 214 metabolites, 6 miRNA, 1 mRNA, and 2 adducts. Here, through the application of sparsity, sPLS attempts to identify subsets of markers within each OMIC level that show significant covariance with another set of OMICs level. The results from such an integration imply a common TRAP-mediated biological response that causes these specific OMIC levels to exhibit correlated fluctuations.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Given that only one mRNA and two adducts were found to be significantly associated with TRAP, sparsity was not applied to mRNA and adducts and only applied to the OMIC level pairs shown in Figure 17. The response,&nbsp; [Y], is kept as a multivariate matrix so any potential un-modelled interactions and complexity arising from the mixture of multivariate OMIC markers can be captured. Although sparsity was not imposed on [Y], looking at their loading coefficients can indicate which response features contribute most to the explained variance.&nbsp;</div>
