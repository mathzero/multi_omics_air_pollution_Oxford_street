<div>These selected metabolite and miRNA markers form the linear combination of features retained by the 'best' component according to the Q2 criterion (see methods). The variances explained by these retained components, unstratified and stratified by location are shown in figure 19 and 20, respectively.&nbsp; The top part of both figures shows the proportion of variance  in Y explained by the retained&nbsp; by X, and in Y by Y, explained by the retained component according to the Q2 criterion. Figure 17 and 18 were derived from the same model, except Figure  18 has been stratified by location, Oxford Street versus Hyde Park.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div>Show the explained variances and Q2 scores first. Explained variances show the summary of the models. - talk about no predictive power because variance explained is very low. Back this up with Q2 score</div>
