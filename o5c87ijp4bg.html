<div></div><div>This analysis was repeated for every OMIC at each of the four OMICs levels: transcripts (miRNA and mRNA), metabolomics and adductomics.&nbsp;To mitigate against false discovery arising from multiple testing, p-values were corrected using the Benjamini–Hochberg method for false discovery rate control, set at&nbsp; 5%.<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Benjamini_1995}</cite></div><div></div><h3 data-label="842352" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Sensitivity analysis</h3><div>To assess the sensitivity of our analysis to outlier data points in the OMICs features, the analysis was run multiple times with caps on the OMICs features to remove outliers above or below specified percentiles (specifically, 5%, 10% and 20%). </div><div></div><h2 data-label="271422" class="ltx_title_subsection">Multi-OMIC integrative analysis</h2><div>The GLS model identified a set of biomarkers for each of the OMIC levels that have significant associations with the&nbsp;experimentally-induced change in TRAP exposure. Based on the assumption that individuals share common biological responses to TRAP pollutants, resulting in similar changes in OMICs measurements,&nbsp;integrative analysis then aims to discover any biological significance, statistically, that links the changes in one OMIC level to another. For example, the differential expression of a transcript mediating the change in&nbsp;measured levels of a metabolite. The integrative techniques applied were network analysis and sparse partial least squares (sPLS) regression. Network analysis takes a broad perspective and isolates statistically significant linkages within and between OMICs levels, while sPLS focuses specifically on&nbsp;<i>between-</i>OMIC associations.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h3 data-label="554852" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Sparse Partial Least Squares (sPLS)</h3><div>sPLS&nbsp;was implemented as a feature selection technique on the sets of significant biomarkers. In this case, both [X] and [Y] are sets of biomarkers from different of OMICs levels identified by GLS as having&nbsp;significant univariate associations with delta-exposure; sPLS then applies sparsity on [X], resulting in a subset of OMICs within each level that is most relevant in describing [Y], another OMIC level. This sparse subset of OMICs, [X], is&nbsp;represented as a linear&nbsp;combination of the OMICs variables that&nbsp;make up the latent variables, or principal components (PCs), that maximises the covariance between [X] and [Y]. Consequently, the final sPLS model requires two optimised parameters: i)&nbsp;the number of components ii) the number of [X] variables to include in those components. This is achieved through a calibration procedure, repeated 100 times, in which the "best" number of components is chosen based on the highest Q2&nbsp;score, and the "best" number of variables to be included in those components is based on the lowest mean squared error of prediction (MSEP) score.&nbsp;Additionally, a multilevel extension of sPLS was used to account for the intraindividual variance imparted by the repeated measurements performed on each subject. This multilevel extension is defined by a design matrix linking a particular OMIC measurement a subject (patient ID). The same sPLS analysis was then stratified by locations to see if OMIC markers relate differently to each other in Oxford Street versus Hyde&nbsp;Park, and to obtain a set of results that are comparable to OMIC markers identified by differential networks.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="250573" class="ltx_title_section">Results</h1><div>In the univariate analysis, one mRNA, six miRNAs, 148 metabolites and two adductomics were found to be significantly associated with TRAP exposure.&nbsp; The single mRNA, three metabolites and one adductomic were found to be significantly associated with more than one TRAP.
