<div></div><div>This analysis was repeated for every OMIC at each of the four OMICs levels: transcripts (miRNA and mRNA), metabolomics and adductomics.&nbsp;To mitigate against false discovery arising from multiple testing, p-values were corrected using the Benjamini–Hochberg method for false discovery rate control, set at&nbsp; 5%.<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Benjamini_1995}</cite></div><div></div><h3 data-label="842352" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Sensitivity analysis</h3><div>To assess the sensitivity of our analysis to outlier data points in the OMICs features, the analysis was run multiple times with caps on the OMICs features to remove outliers above or below specified percentiles (specifically, 5%, 10% and 20%). </div><div></div><h2 data-label="271422" class="ltx_title_subsection">Multi-OMIC integrative analysis</h2><div>The GLS model identified a set of biomarkers for each of the OMIC levels that have significant associations with the&nbsp;experimentally-induced change in TRAP exposure. Based on the assumption that individuals share common biological responses to TRAP pollutants, resulting in similar changes in OMICs measurements,&nbsp;integrative analysis then aims to discover any biological significance, statistically, that links the changes in one OMIC level to another. For example, the differential expression of a transcript mediating the change in&nbsp;measured levels of a metabolite. The integrative techniques applied were network analysis and sparse partial least squares (sPLS) regression. Network analysis takes a broad perspective and isolates statistically significant linkages within and between OMICs levels, while sPLS focuses specifically on&nbsp;<i>between-</i>OMIC associations.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h3 data-label="776082" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Network Analysis</h3><div>To investigate and visualise biological pathways and relationships within and between OMICs levels, a range of network analysis techniques were applied. At the most basic level, marginal networks examined the pairwise relationships between biomarkers. P-values for covariance of each biomarker pairing were derived, and corrected for multiple testing using a Bonferroni adjustment. As four levels of OMIC were being analysed, the correlation matrix contained 10 inter-OMIC and intra-OMIC&nbsp;regions, and each region was adjusted for false discovery according to the size of the region (and therefore the number of tests conducted in that region). </div>
