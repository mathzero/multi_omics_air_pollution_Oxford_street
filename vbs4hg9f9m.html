<div>In the marginal network analysis (figure <span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true">12</span>), clusters of highly inter-related metabolomic biomarkers are apparent. There is no significant inter-OMIC level covariance. Networks were also constructed for each experimental site separately, although these did not add anything to the analysis (network schematics segmented by location, and differential networks, are included in the Appendix).</div><div></div><div>Conditional network analysis – where edges are only defined when there is a significant relationship between the nodes, conditionally on all the other nodes – reveals a much sparser network (figure <span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true">13</span>). </div><div></div>
